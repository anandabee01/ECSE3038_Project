IoT stands for Internet of Things, and it refers to the network of physical objects or "things" that are connected to the internet and can communicate with each other to perform certain tasks.

An IoT platform is a software solution that enables the management, deployment, and integration of IoT devices and data. It allows users to control and monitor their IoT devices from a centralized location, and it provides the necessary tools for collecting and analyzing data generated by these devices.

The goal of this project is to build an IoT platform that controls simple appliances that are typically controlled by the clip of a switch, e.g. lighting appliances like lamps or in-wall lighting fixtures, and cooling/heating appliances such as fans and air conditioning units.

The platform should also allow users to interact with the IoT devices through the use of a webpage.
